1. **Question Analysis Phase**

   - Primary role receives the question
   - Analyzes if the question would benefit from another perspective
   - Determines which other role would be most relevant to consult

2. **Role Selection Criteria** ✅

   - Define specific triggers or keywords that suggest need for collaboration ✅
   - Create a mapping of which roles complement each other ✅
   - Example pairs:
     - Dream Interpreter + Consciousness Explorer for symbolic meanings
     - Philosopher + Psychologist for behavioral questions
     - Scientist + Mystic for bridging rational and spiritual perspectives

3. **Consultation Flow**

   1. Primary role forms initial thoughts
   2. Decides if consultation needed
   3. If yes:
      - Formulates specific questions for secondary role
      - Receives secondary role's input
      - Synthesizes both perspectives
   4. Delivers final response incorporating both viewpoints

4. **Response Structure**

   - Clear indication that multiple roles contributed
   - Attribution of which insights came from which role
   - Synthesis of how the perspectives complement each other
   - Final unified response that leverages both viewpoints

5. **Edge Cases to Consider**
   - What if the question needs more than two roles?
   - How to handle disagreements between roles?
   - How to maintain coherent conversation flow?
   - How to prevent response length from becoming too long?
